- changing current in one coil induces an emf in an adjacent coil
	- coupling between the coils is described by their mutual inductance
- changing current in a coil also induces an emf in that same coil
	- this coil is called an inductor
- relationship of current to emf is described by inductance or self-inductance depending on the situation
