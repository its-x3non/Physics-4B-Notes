- if the magnetic flux changes, an emf and a current are induced in the circuit
- Lenz's law - predict the directions of induced emfs and currents
- Faraday's law - central principle of electromagnetic induction; relates induced emf to changing magnetic flux in any loop, like a closed circuit
- time-varying electric field can act as a source of a magnetic field
- Maxwell's equations - describes the behavior of electric and magnetic fields
- magnetic flux changes either because of how the magnetic field changes with time or because the coil is moving through a nonuniform magnetic field
	- induced emf is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux $\Phi_{B}$ through the coil
	- direction of induced emf depends on whether the flux is increasing or decreasing
		- if flux is constant, no induced emf
- magnetically induced emfs are the result of non-electrostatic forces
	- electrostatic electric fields are produced by charges
	- non-electrostatic electric fields are produced by changing magnetic fields

**Faraday's Law**
- common element in all induction effects is changing magnetic flux through a circuit
	- $d\Phi_{B}=\vec{B}\cdot d\vec{A}=B_{\perp} \:dA=B\:dA\:\cos\phi$ 
		- $B_{\perp}$ is the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the surface of the area element and $\phi$ is the angle between them ($\Phi_{B}$ is flux, not angle)
- if magnetic field and area vector are parallel, then $\Phi_{B}=\vec{B}\cdot\vec{A}=BA$ 
- if surface is angled slightly from magnetic field, then $\Phi_{B}=\vec{B}\cdot\vec{A}=BA\cos\phi$ 
- if surface is edge on to magnetic field ($\phi=90\degree$ ), then $\Phi_{B}=\vec{B}\cdot\vec{A}=BA\cos(90\degree)=0$ 
- Faraday's law of induction states: $\varepsilon=-\frac{d\Phi_{B}}{dt}$  
	- induced emf in a closed loop equals the negative of the time rate of change of magnetic flux thru the loop (change in magnetic field, area, or both)

**Lenz's Law**
- alternative for determining the direction of an induced current or emf
- the direction of any magnetic induction effect is such as to oppose the cause of the effect
	- change in flux goes in one direction, so the current of the magnetic field should go in the opposite way to reduce flux
		- if flux is increasing, then the current should induce a magnetic field that decreases flux
		- if the flux is decreasing, then the current should induce a magnetic field that makes flux decrease less/additive to flux
