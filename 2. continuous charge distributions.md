- continuous charge distribution - an electric charge with shape
	- determine electric fields which surround continuous charge distributions by using coulomb's law and electric field equations
		- coulomb's law: $\vec{F_{e}}=k\frac{(q_{1})(q_{2})}{r^{2}}\hat{r}$
		- electric field: $\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F_{e}}}{q}$
		- electric field that surrounds and is caused by a point charge: $\vec{E}_{\textup{point charge}}=k\frac{kQ}{r^{2}}\hat{r}$
	- charged object consists of an infinite number of infinitesimally small point charges (dq)
	- sum the infinite number of electric fields, dE, via superposition (aka an integral)
		- $d\vec{E}=\frac{k(\textup{d}q)}{r^{2}}\hat{r}\Rightarrow \int d\vec{E}=\int \frac{k(\textup{d}q)}{r^{2}}\hat{r}\Rightarrow\vec{E}_{\textup{cont charge dist}}=k\int \frac{\textup{d}q}{r^{2}}\hat{r}$
- linear charge density (over a line): $\lambda = \frac{Q}{L} \: \textup{in} \: \frac{C}{m}$
- surface charge density (over an area): $\sigma = \frac{Q}{A} \: \textup{in} \: \frac{C}{m^2}$
- volumetric charge density (over a volume): $\rho =\frac{Q}{V} \:\textup{in} \: \frac{C}{m^3}$
