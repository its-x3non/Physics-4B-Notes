- **electric charge** 
	- fundamental property of matter
	- charge carriers are protons and electrons
	- all have same magnitude elementary charge called e $$e = 1.60 \times10^{-19} C$$
	- C (coulombs) are not a base SI unit
	- charge is a scalar
	- charge is quantized, intervals of e $$Q = ne$$
		- meanings of each variable: $$\begin{align*} 
		Q &= \textup{integer net charge on object}\\
n &=  \textup{interger number of excess charge carriers, pos or neg depending on carrier} \\
e &= \textup{elementary charge}
\end{align*}$$
	- example: object w 4 protons and 6 electrons $$\begin{align*} Q_{object} &= Q_{protons}+ Q_{electrons} \\
	&= (+4)(e)+(-6)(e) \\
	&= (-2)(e) \\
	Q_{object} &= (-2)(1.60\times 10^{-19}) = -3.20\times 10^{-19} C \\ 
	\end{align*}$$
- coulomb's law: equation for electrostatic force between two charged objects $$\vec{F_{e}}=k\frac{(q_{1})(q_{2})}{r^{2}}\hat{r}$$
	- meanings of each variable: $$\begin{align*} k &= \textup{Coulomb constant} (\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}}) \\
q &= \textup{charges of the two objects} \\
r &= \textup{distance between centers of charge} \\
\hat{r} &= \textup{vector directed from one charge to the other} \\
\epsilon_{0} &= 8.85\times 10^{-12} \frac{C^{2}}{N\cdot m^{2}} \textup{(premittivity of free space)} \\ \end{align*}$$
	- similar to newton's universal law of motion
- law of conservation of charge
	- net charge of a system does not change
	- typically electrons move in a system
	- isolated system = no way for electrons to leave or enter the system
		- net charge of system stays constant
	- similar to law of conservation of momentum???
- **electric fields** 
	- place a small positive test charge in an electric field, it experiences electrostatic force $$\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F_{e}}}{q}$$
		- test charge has very small charge that does not change the electric field it is in; only for test purposes
		- it is just convention how all electric fields are defined; using a small pos test charge
	- electric fields and electrostatic force are vectors
	- directions of electric field and net electrostatic force: 
		- on a positively charged obj are in the same direction 
		- on a negatively charged obj are opposite in direction 
	- electric field map around a single positive point charge would point outwards, while negative point charge would point toward the point charge
		- equation form: $$\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F_{e}}}{q} \Rightarrow E_{+ point charge}=\frac{\frac{kqQ}{r^{2}}}{q}=\frac{kQ}{r^{2}}$$
		- meaning of variables with positive charge: $$\begin{align*} q &= \textup{charge on a small, positive test charge} \\
Q &= \textup{charge on positive point charge} \\
r &= \textup{distance from Q to position of q} \end{align*}$$
		- equation except w/ negative point charge: $$\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F_{e}}}{q} \Rightarrow E_{- point charge}=\frac{\frac{kq(-Q)}{r^{2}}}{q}=-\frac{kQ}{r^{2}}$$
		- meaning of variables except with negative point charge: $$\begin{align*} q &= \textup{charge on a small, positive test charge} \\
-Q &= \textup{charge on negative point charge} \\
r &= \textup{distance from -Q to position of q} \end{align*}$$
