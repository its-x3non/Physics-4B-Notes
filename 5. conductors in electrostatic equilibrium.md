- conductors - materials where electrons are free to move easily
	- when a conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium, it has stationary charge $(E_{inside}=0)$ 
		- if $E_{inside}$ is not equal to 0, then the electrical forces are not summing to 0, therefore there is no electrical field (electrostatic shielding)
		- all excess charges are on the surface(s) of the conductor $$\Phi_{E}=\oint\vec{E}\cdot\textup{d}\vec{A}= \frac{q_{enclosed}}{\epsilon_{0}}\: \textup{and}\: E_{inside}=0\Rightarrow 0= \frac{q_{enclosed}}{\epsilon_{0}}\Rightarrow q_{enclosed}=0$$
		- electric fields just outside conductors are perpendicular to the surface and are equal to local surface charge density divided by permittivity of free space $$E_{just\:outside}= \frac{\sigma_{local}}{\epsilon_{0}}$$
			- if electric field had a component parallel to the surface, the charges would accelerate, and the conductor is not in electrostatic equilibrium
			- because equipotential surfaces are always perpendicular to the electric field, the surface must be an equipotential surface
		- for irregular shapes, the local surface charge density is at its max where curvature is at minimum
