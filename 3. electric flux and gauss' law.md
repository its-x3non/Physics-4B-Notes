- flux - any effect that appears to pass or travel thru a surface or substance
- electric flux (equivalent to work): $$ \Phi _{E}=\vec{E}\cdot\vec{A}=EA\cos\theta \Rightarrow (\frac{N}{C})m^{2}=\frac{N\cdot m^{2}}{C}$$
	- variable meanings: $$ \begin{align*} \Phi &= \textup{greek letter phi (net electric flux)} \\ E &= \textup{uniform electric field} \\ A &= \textup{area of surface thru whuch the uniform electric field passes thru} \\ \theta &= \textup{angle between directions of E and A} \end{align*} $$
- gauss' law: $$ \Phi_{E} = \oint \vec{E}\cdot\textup{d}\vec{A}=\frac{q_{enclosed}}{\epsilon_{0}}$$
- aka: $$E=\frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_{0}\:\textup{area}}$$ 
	- circle integral just specifies that it is over an enclosed surface
	- relates electric flux thru a gaussian surface
		- gaussian surface - a 3D closed surface
		- choose gaussian surfaces shape such that the electric field generated by enclosed charge is either perpendicular or parallel to the sides of the gaussian surface or: $$ \cos\theta = -1,0, \: \textup{or} \: 1 $$
		- if amt of charge enclosed in gaussian surface is constant, total electric flux thru gaussian surface does not depend on the size of the gaussian surface
	- gauss' law is the first of maxwell's equations
		- maxwell's equations - a collection of eqs that fully describe electromagnetism (will learn more abt them later on)
	- if enclosed charge is 0, then there is no net electric flux $$ \textup{if} \: q_{enclosed}=0, \:\textup{then}\: \frac{q_{enclosed}}{\epsilon_{0}}=0=\Phi_{0}$$
