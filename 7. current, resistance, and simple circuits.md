- electric current $I$: total electric charge which passes by a point over a time period $\frac{\textup{d}q}{\textup{d}t}$
	- measured in amperes $A$, aka $\frac{\textup{coulombs},C}{\textup{seconds},s}$  
	- occurs when there is an electric potential difference across a wire
		- $\Delta V=0\Rightarrow I=0$ 
	- direction of conventional current is the direction positive charges would flow
	- change in charge: $\Delta Q=nVq$ 
		- $n$=charge carrier density
		- $V$=volume
		- $q$=charge per carrier
